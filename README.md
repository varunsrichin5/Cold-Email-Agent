# Cold Email Agent üìßü§ñ

Hey there! Welcome to my Cold Email Agent project. This is a fun little experiment I've been working on to see if I can make cold emailing less of a pain (and maybe a bit more effective).

What's This All About?
Ever sent a bunch of cold emails and thought, "There's gotta be a better way"? Well, that's exactly what I was thinking when I started this project. This Cold Email Agent is my attempt to mix AI, some cool APIs, and a bit of automation magic to streamline the whole cold email process.

Cool Stuff It Can Do

üß† Comes up with email campaign ideas (so you don't have to stare at a blank screen)
üïµÔ∏è Finds potential leads using Hunter.io (because manually searching is so 2010)
‚úçÔ∏è Writes personalized emails using AI (no more copy-paste nightmares)
üì§ Sends out emails automatically (while you grab a coffee)
üìä Keeps an eye on how things are going with some fancy monitoring

Tech I'm Playing With

Python (because who doesn't love Python?)
CrewAI (for managing all the moving parts)
LangChain & OpenAI's GPT-4 (for the smart stuff)
Hunter.io API (for finding those elusive email addresses)
Mailjet API (for actually sending emails)
LangSmith (to see what's going on under the hood)
Streamlit (for a simple UI, because command lines are scary)

Want to Give It a Spin?
What You'll Need

Python 3.8 or newer
A bunch of API keys (OpenAI, Hunter.io, Mailjet, LangSmith)
A curious mind and a bit of patience (it's a side project, after all!)

Setting It Up

Install the goodies:
Copypip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file and add your secret stuff:
CopyOPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
HUNTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
MAILJET_API_KEY=your_key_here
MAILJET_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=your@email.com
FROM_NAME=Your Name
ORGANIZATION=Your Cool Company
POSITION=Email Wizard
WEBSITE=https://your-awesome-site.com
PHONE_NUMBER=1234567890


Firing It Up

Let's get this party started:
Copystreamlit run main.py

Head over to http://localhost:8501 in your browser
Type in what kind of email campaign you're dreaming of and hit that "Run Campaign" button!

What's Inside

main.py: Where all the magic happens
requirements.txt: A list of Python packages you'll need
.env: Your secret stuff (don't share this!)
README.md: Well, you're reading it!

Ideas for Making It Even Cooler

Maybe add some social media stuff? Slide into those DMs!
Teach it to understand when people reply (and maybe reply back?)
Hook it up to a CRM system (if you're feeling fancy)
Make the emails sound even more human-like (but not too human, that's creepy)
Add some emojis to the emails (because why not? üéâ)

Want to Tinker With It?
Feel free to fork, modify, or do whatever you want with this code. If you make it do something awesome, let me know!
Just Remember
This is all in good fun, but remember to play nice. Don't spam people, and make sure you're following the rules when it comes to email marketing. Be cool, okay?
Shoutouts
Big thanks to the folks at OpenAI, CrewAI, LangChain, Hunter.io, and Mailjet. Your tools made this little project possible!
Happy emailing! üöÄ‚úâÔ∏è
